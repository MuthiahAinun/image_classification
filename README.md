# 🧠 Intel Image Classification with CNN 🌐

Welcome to an intelligent image classification project built with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and deployed with **TensorFlow.js**! 🚀 This project can classify outdoor scene images like **buildings**, **mountains**, **forest**, and more using deep learning.

## 🌟 Features
- Built with TensorFlow
- Custom CNN architecture
- Augmented training using `ImageDataGenerator`
- Supports early stopping and `ReduceLROnPlateau`
- Evaluates model with detailed classification report
- Exported to TFLite format for inference
